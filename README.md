  <h1>Machine Learning Malware Detector</h1>
  <p>This Python script is designed to process and analyze malware data to train a machine learning model for malware detection.</p>

  <h2>Script Overview</h2>
  <p>The script performs the following main tasks:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Data loading and preprocessing.</li>
      <li>Initial data analysis including checking for missing values and duplicates.</li>
      <li>Data visualization to understand feature distributions.</li>
      <li>Feature selection using statistical methods.</li>
      <li>Model training and evaluation.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>The script requires the following Python libraries:</p>
  <ul>
       <li>pandas</li>
       <li>numpy</li>
       <li>matplotlib</li>
       <li>sklearn</li>
       <li>seaborn</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Usage</h2>
   <p>To use the script, ensure that the required data file 'ClaMP_Integrated-5184.csv' is present in the same directory as the script. Run the script using the following command:</p>
   <pre><code>python script.py</code></pre>

   <h2>Functionality</h2>
   <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
   <p>The script starts by loading the data and performing basic preprocessing such as removing duplicates and handling missing values.</p>

   <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
   <p>Various data analysis steps are performed such as summarizing the data and checking for duplicates and null values.</p>

   <h3>Feature Selection</h3>
   <p>Feature selection is carried out to identify the most significant features for the machine learning model.</p>

   <h3>Model Training</h3>
   <p>The script trains a machine learning model using the processed data.</p>

   <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
   <p>After training, the script evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</p>

   <h2>Expected Output</h2>
   <p>The script outputs the performance metrics of the trained machine learning model and may also output visualizations to aid in the analysis.</p>

   <h2>Notes</h2>
   <p>The script is designed for educational and research purposes and should be adapted based on the specific data and use case.</p>
